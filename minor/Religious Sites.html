            Holy places have always been essential to the proper worship of God. For Latter-day Saints, 
            such holy places include venues of historic significance, our homes, sacrament meetings, and temples. Much of what we reverence,
             and what we teach our children to reverence as holy and sacred, is reflected in these places.
