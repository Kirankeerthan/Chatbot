            Kailkonda fort and Koil Sagar dam are considered to be the most adventurous places in Hyderabad. reaching the top of the hill is not at a piece of cake, you would have to start your trekking and walk through the west and cross a number of streams on the east.
             Oh and did we forget to mention that you'd also need to walk a lot of steps that lead to the fort? however, the end result is gonna be nothing less than a surprise.
             Koil Sagar dam is almost 10 km away from the fort.

            Narsapur forest sits peacefully right beside Bala Nagar junction and is wrapped between the lush green forest and beautiful creatures that reside in. And on a scale of one to ten, how happy would it make you if we tell that there's a small lake amidst the forest. At that ghat area, you can find fellow trekkers sitting, chilling and chatting. You can consider this your snacking time before you complete your trek.
            It takes almost 5 hours to complete the trip but the end result would leave you glowing.
